Preview

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.

To see an example of using Vertex AI Model Optimizer, run the "Getting Started with Model Optimizer" notebook in one of the following environments:

Open in Colab | Open in Colab Enterprise | Open in Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks | View on GitHub

Vertex AI Model Optimizer is a dynamic endpoint designed to simplify model selection by automatically applying the Gemini model which best meets your needs. This lets you point your prompts at a single meta-endpoint and the service intelligently selects the most appropriate Gemini model for your query (Pro, Flash, etc.) based on your cost and quality preferences.

For more information on Model Optimizer pricing, see Pricing.

Benefits

Model Optimizer lets you:

Simplify your model selection rather than choosing a model for each application
Optimize for cost, quality, or both, letting you balance performance and budget
Integrate seamlessly with existing Gemini APIs and SDKs
Track usage and identify potential for cost savings
Efficiently handle text-based tasks without a need for manual endpoint selection
Supported models
Gemini 2.0 Flash (GA)
Gemini 2.5 Pro (preview, 03-25)
Language support

Model Optimizer supports all languages that are also supported by the Gemini models. (See Gemini Language support)

Modality

Model Optimizer supports text use cases, including:

Coding, including function calling and code execution
Summarization
Single and multi-turn chat
Question and answering

For limitations and how to handle them, see Handling unsupported features.

Getting started

To get started with Model Optimizer, see our quickstart Colab notebook.

Handling unsupported features

Model Optimizer only supports text input and output. However, the request could include different modalities or tools that aren't supported. The following sections cover how Model Optimizer handles these unsupported features.

Multimodal requests

Requests that include prompts with multimodal data, such as video, images or audio, will throw an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

Unsupported tools

Model Optimizer only supports function declaration for requests. If a request contains other tool types including google_maps, google_search, enterprise_web_search, retrieval, or browse, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is thrown.
