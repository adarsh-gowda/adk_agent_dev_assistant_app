Release Notes
This document defines key terms related to the lifecycle of Gemini and embedding models on Vertex AI. It also provides recommended upgrade paths and guidance on migrating to the latest model versions.

Key Terms
Stable model: A publicly released model version that is available and supported for production use. A stable model is typically released with a retirement date, after which it will no longer be accessible or supported.
Latest stable model: The most recent version within a model family. It is recommended for all new and active projects and should be the target for migrations from earlier.
Legacy stable model: A model version that has been superseded by a newer stable model. While still supported, you should migrate to the latest model to access new features and improvements. Access to legacy models may be restricted for new projects.
Retired model: A model version that is past its retirement date and has been permanently deactivated. API requests to a retired model will fail.
Recommended upgrade: The latest stable model that we recommend switching to. Latest stable models typically offer better performance and more capabilities.

Migrate to a latest stable model

When a model you are using is approaching its retirement date, you must migrate your applications to a newer version. We offer two paths for migration depending on your needs.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with code snippets or setup, refer to the Troubleshooting Guide.

Recommended Migration Process
Quick Migration

For a structured migration that minimizes risk and verifies optimal performance, we recommend following our detailed guide. This guide provides a comprehensive set of steps to help you test and deploy new models effectively.

Gemini auto-updated aliases

An auto-updated alias for a Gemini model always points to the latest stable version. When a new stable model is released, the alias automatically updates to the new version. Using an alias enables your application to always use the latest stable model without requiring code changes.

The following table shows the available auto-updated aliases and the stable versions they reference.

Auto-updated alias	Stable version reference
gemini-2.0-flash-lite	gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001
gemini-2.0-flash	gemini-2.0-flash-001
gemini-1.5-pro	gemini-1.5-pro-002
gemini-1.5-flash	gemini-1.5-flash-002
