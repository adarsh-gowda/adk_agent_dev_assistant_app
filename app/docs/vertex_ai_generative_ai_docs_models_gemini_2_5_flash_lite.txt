Release Notes

Preview

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.

Important: Only the global endpoint is supported for this preview version. For more information, see Global endpoint.

Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is our most balanced Gemini model, optimized for low latency use cases. It comes with the same capabilities that make other Gemini 2.5 models helpful, such as the ability to turn thinking on at different budgets, connecting to tools like Grounding with Google Search and code execution, multimodal input, and a 1 million-token context length.

For even more detailed technical information on Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (such as performance benchmarks, information on our training datasets, efforts on sustainability, intended usage and limitations, and our approach to ethics and safety), see our technical report on our Gemini 2.5 models.

Try in Vertex AI (Preview) Deploy example app

Note: To use the "Deploy example app" feature, you need a Google Cloud project with billing and Vertex AI API enabled.
