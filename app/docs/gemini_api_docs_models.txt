Gemini models

2.5 Pro spark

Our most powerful thinking model with maximum response accuracy and state-of-the-art performance

Input audio, images, video, and text, get text responses
Tackle difficult problems, analyze large databases, and more
Best for complex coding, reasoning, and multimodal understanding

2.5 Flash spark

Our best model in terms of price-performance, offering well-rounded capabilities.

Input audio, images, video, and text, and get text responses
Model thinks as needed; or, you can configure a thinking budget
Best for low latency, high volume tasks that require thinking

2.5 Flash-Lite experiment

A Gemini 2.5 Flash model optimized for cost efficiency and low latency.

Input audio, images, video, and text, and get text responses
Most cost-efficient model supporting high throughput
Best for real time, low latency use cases
Note: Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash come with thinking on by default. If you're migrating from a non-thinking model such as 2.0 Pro or Flash, we recommend you to review the Thinking guide first.

Model version name patterns

Gemini models are available in either stable, preview, or experimental versions. In your code, you can use one of the following model name formats to specify which model and version you want to use.

Latest stable

Points to the most recent stable version released for the specified model generation and variation.

To specify the latest stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>. For example, gemini-2.0-flash.

Stable

Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most production apps should use a specific stable model.

To specify a stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.0-flash-001.

Preview

Points to a preview model which may not be suitable for production use, come with more restrictive rate limits, but may have billing enabled.

To specify a preview version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05.

Experimental

Points to an experimental model which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits. We release experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly.

To specify an experimental version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05.

Experimental models

In addition to stable models, the Gemini API offers experimental models which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits.

We release experimental models to gather feedback, get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly, and highlight the pace of innovation happening at Google. What we learn from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely. An experimental model can be swapped for another without prior notice. We don't guarantee that an experimental model will become a stable model in the future.

Previous experimental models

As new versions or stable releases become available, we remove and replace experimental models. You can find the previous experimental models we released in the following section along with the replacement version:
