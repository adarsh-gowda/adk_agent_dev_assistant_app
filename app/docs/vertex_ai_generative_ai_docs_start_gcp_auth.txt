Configure application default credentials
bookmark_border

To use Gemini on Vertex AI, you need to authenticate by using a Google Cloud API key or by using application default credentials. We recommend using an API key for testing and using application default credentials for production. This page shows you how to configure application default credentials.

Before you begin
Select a project, enable billing, enable the Vertex AI API, install gcloud CLI
Create local authentication credentials

If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account:

gcloud auth application-default login

You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.

If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity.

Make your first API request

After configuring application default credentials, learn how to make your first request in the API quickstart.
