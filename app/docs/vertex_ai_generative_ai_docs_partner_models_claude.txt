Anthropic's Claude models
bookmark_border

To see an example of using Anthropic's Claude model on Vertex AI, run the "Use Anthropic's Claude model on Vertex AI" notebook in one of the following environments:

Open in Colab | Open in Colab Enterprise | Open in Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks | View on GitHub

The Anthropic Claude models on Vertex AI offer fully managed and serverless models as APIs. To use a Claude model on Vertex AI, send a request directly to the Vertex AI API endpoint. Because the Anthropic Claude models use a managed API, there's no need to provision or manage infrastructure.

You can stream your Claude responses to reduce the end-user latency perception. A streamed response uses server-sent events (SSE) to incrementally stream the response.

You pay for Claude models as you use them (pay as you go), or you pay a fixed fee when using [provisioned throughput][pt]. For pay-as-you-go pricing, see Anthropic Claude models on the Vertex AI pricing page.

Available Claude models

The following models are available from Anthropic to use in Vertex AI. To access a Claude model, go to its Model Garden model card.

Anthropic's Claude models support Vertex AI request-response logging. Enable 30-day request-response logging of your prompt and completion activity to track any model misuse by your users. For more information, see Log requests and responses.
