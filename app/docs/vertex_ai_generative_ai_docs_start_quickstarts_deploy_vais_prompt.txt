Quickstart: Deploy your Vertex AI Studio prompt as a web application
bookmark_border

Preview

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.

In Vertex AI Studio, you can design and iterate your prompts and compare results from different configurations and models. Once you finish engineering your prompt, you can deploy your prompt as a web application to share with your collaborators or target users to let them test out the web application. The web application is hosted on Cloud Run and is available outside the Google Cloud console.

In this quick start, you will:

Create a prompt with prompt variables
Deploy your prompt as a web application
Monitor deployment progress and test the deployed application
Update and re-deploy your prompt
Test out prompt submission with multimodal supports
Before you start

If you have never used Vertex AI Studio before, you can follow another quickstart guide or take the Google Cloud Skills Boost course to learn the basics of Vertex AI Studio. In this guide, you should have the following:

A Google Cloud project created with billing enabled
Vertex AI API enabled
Additional permissions required

On top of existing permissions to use Vertex AI Studio, in order to deploy your prompt, you need to have the following permissions:

Action	Required permissions	Purpose
Enable additional APIs	serviceusage.services.enable	Enable the following APIs:
Cloud Run Admin API (run.googleapis.com)
Artifact Registry API (artifactregistry.googleapis.com)
Cloud Build API (cloudbuild.googleapis.com)
Cloud Logging API (logging.googleapis.com)

Grant permissions to service accounts	resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy	Grant the Compute Engine default service account the following roles:
Vertex AI Service Agent (roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent)
Cloud Build Service Account (roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder)

Deploy specific permissions	
storage.buckets.create
run.services.create
artifactregistry.repositories.create
run.services.setIamPolicy
	During deployment, a set of source codes will be uploaded to Cloud Storage and then be deployed to Cloud Run with a new service created. The artifactregistry.repositories.create is required to create a repository for the container image. The run.services.setIamPolicy is required to make the service publicly accessible.

If you are the owner of your project, you don't need to take additional actions but follow the guides in the Vertex AI Studio. If you are not the owner of your project, ask your project administrator to perform the first two actions, and then grant you the Editor (roles/editor) and the Cloud Run Admin (roles/run.admin) roles.

Create a prompt with prompt variables

Navigate to the create prompt page of Vertex AI Studio, and then click data_object Add variable in the prompt input box.

In the Manage prompt variables dialog, enter a variable name and give it a value. Then click Apply.

In the prompt input box, compose the prompt using the variable and then adjust other parameters. For example, you can enable Grounding with Google Search, and has "Always get current weather from the web" as the system instructions.

Deploy your prompt as a web application

To deploy your prompt as a web application, click the Build with code button on the top right corner. Then click Deploy as app.

Save the prompt

The save prompt dialog will pop up, as saving is required before a prompt can be deployed. The deploy dialog will open automatically once the prompt has been saved.

Note: Saving your prompt in a region for the first time can take 2-3 minutes to complete. A warning box will appear after 1 minute. This is expected to be a one-time slow operation. Any subsequent prompt saving actions when using the same project and region will only take a few seconds.
Enable APIs for the first deployment and grant permissions

Once the prompt is saved, the deployment process will continue. If this is your first deployment, you will see a dialog for enabling required APIs. Click Enable required APIs.

After the APIs are enabled, the Create a web app dialog will appear. As a Public Preview feature, access control is not supported. Therefore, all deployed applications will allow public access. Don't include sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) in your prompt.

Check the I understand this app will be deployed publicly checkbox, and then click Create app.

If this is your first deployment, another dialog will pop up asking you to grant the required roles to the service account. Click Grant all to proceed.

Note: If you don't have permissions to enable APIs or to grant access, ask your project administrator to grant the necessary permissions for you. See the additional permissions required for more details.
Deployment starts

Vertex AI Studio will create a zip file that contains the source code for the web application and will upload the zip file to a Cloud Storage bucket. After deployment starts, the Manage web app dialog will pop up with information about your deployment, such as your application's name, when it was last deployed, its deployment status, and more.

Monitoring the deployment status

Deployment takes 2-3 minutes to complete, and the deployment status is shown in the Status column of the Manage web app dialog. If you close the Manage web app dialog, you can reopen it from the menu under the Build with code button.

Once the deployment is complete, the status column will change to Ready, and the Open button will appear next to the application name.

Access control and secret key

Your web application is deployed with Allow unauthenticated access control enabled by default. You can turn it off by clicking the edit pencil icon button. See the turn off public access section for more information.

To provide basic protection, the web application requires a secret key to be appended to the URL for submitting the prompt. You can find the secret key in the Secret Key column. If you open the web application from Vertex AI Studio, the key will be appended to the URL for you.

Open the web application and submit the prompt

Click Open in the Manage web app dialog to access the deployed application. The application should be opened with the secret key appended to the URL in the format of ?key=SECRET_KEY.

Enter a value to the variable and then click Submit. You should be able to see the results on the right.

Open the web application from the Build with code button menu

If your web application is ready, you can also open it from the Build with code button menu.

Cloud Run is a serverless service, which means that the container for the application will be shut down if it is not actively used. Therefore, the web application can sometimes take a few seconds to load, or a submission won't work if you have left the web application idling for too long. Refreshing the page should solve this issue.

Monitoring the status from the notification bell

You can also monitor the status from the Notifications menu by clicking the bell icon. The bell icon will stop its loading animation and show a green circle if deployment is completed successfully.

If you click the notification, it will redirect you to the Cloud Run page. The URL in the Cloud Run page does not have the secret key appended. You will need to manually append it in the format ?key=SECRET_KEY.

Update and re-deploy your prompt

You can further edit your prompt in Vertex AI Studio and turn the prompt into a conversation. Then click the Build with code button and click Manage app to open the Manage web app dialog. Click Update app to re-deploy your web application with the updated prompt.

A confirmation dialog will appear. It tells you that if you redeploy, you will lose any changes that you made to the deployed web application outside Vertex AI Studio (such as in the Cloud Run source code editor). Click Confirm to proceed.

The Manage web app dialog will pop up again. The process is similar to the initial deployment. You can monitor the progress in the same way as the first deployment.

After the update is done, you can open the web application again. You will see the conversation UI with the prompt variable. Fill in the value and type any non-empty content to continue the conversation.

Insert multimodal content

You can insert inputs such as images, video, audio, and documents into the conversation UI. What inputs are supported depends on the model selected for the prompt. See the documentation for multimodal support for each model.

To insert a file, click the  clip icon button in the conversation input box.

You will be able to interact with the model with the input you provide.

Advanced Topics

Once you are familiar with the deployment process, you can consider the following actions.

Edit source code in Cloud Run
Turn off public access
Turn on public access again
Set up local access for development
Common issues
Authentication error: No secret key
Authentication error: Invalid secret key
