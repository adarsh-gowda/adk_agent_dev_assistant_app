Migrate to Imagen 3
bookmark_border

This guide explains how to migrate your applications from Imagen 1 and Imagen 2 to Imagen 3.

Why migrate to Imagen 3?

Starting on June 24, 2025, Imagen versions 1 and 2, Image Captioning, and Visual Questioning Answering are deprecated. Imagen models imagegeneration@002, imagegeneration@005, and imagegeneration@006 will be removed on September 24, 2025 .

Imagen 3 offers performance improvements over Imagen 1 and Imagen 2.

Upgrading most Imagen applications to Imagen 3 shouldn't require significant reengineering of prompts or code. But some applications may require prompt changes, and these changes are difficult to predict without running a prompt through Imagen 3 first.

Which Imagen 3 model should I migrate to?

The Imagen workloads that you use determine which Imagen 3 model we recommend for your migration.

The following table shows common workloads for Imagen 1 and Imagen 2 models and their support by Imagen 3 models:

Feature	imagegeneration@002	imagegeneration@005	imagegeneration@006	imagen-3.0-
capability-001	generate-002
Image generation	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes
Digital watermarking and verification	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes
User-configurable safety settings	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
Image customization	No	No	Yes	Yes	No
Subject customization for product, person, and animal companion	Yes	No	No	Yes	No
Style customization	Yes	No	No	Yes	No
Mask-based image editing	Yes	No	No	Yes	No
Mask-free image editing	Yes	No	No	No	No
Insertion or removal image editing (inpainting)	No	No	Yes	Yes	No
Outpainting	No	No	Yes	Yes	No
Product image editing	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No
Upscaling	Yes	No	No	No	No
Negative prompts	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No
Person generation	No	No	Yes	No	Yes
Non-English text prompting	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
How do I migrate?

In most cases you can update the model name that you are using to use an Imagen 3 model with no further changes to your parameters. The following sections provide exceptions that may affect you.

Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering

If you use Imagen's Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering features, we recommend that you migrate to Gemini Image Understanding for improved capabilities for analyzing and describing images.

For more information, see Image understanding.

Inpainting, outpainting, and product editing

Inpainting, outpainting, and product editing require API changes when migrating to Imagen 3 models. For more information, see the following:

Inpainting insert content (bring your own mask)

Outpainting

Product image editing (automatic background detection)

Personalization

For avatar stylization, migrate from Imagen 2 Personalization to Imagen 3's Subject customization, which provides improved capabilities.

Are there pricing changes?

There may be pricing changes for upgrading from earlier Imagen models.
